NAIVE Model
=================

This module introduces the `NAIVE_Predictor` class, designed to implement naive forecasting 
techniques for time series data to be used as a benchmark for analyzing the performance of the machine learning models.
The class is constructed to provide basic prediction strategies, such as using the last observed value, 
the mean of the dataset, or the last observed seasonal value as forecasts. 
It is also useful for initial assessments of time series forecasting tasks, 
offering various naive methods to quickly generate forecasts without complex modeling.
